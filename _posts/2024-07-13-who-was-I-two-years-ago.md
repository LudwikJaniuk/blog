Two years ago, in the summer of 2022, I had a loving girlfriend. I was one year into my new job, trying to find my way around there. 
I thought I had to demonstrate my abilities, show everyone what I'm capable of of. I was meeting many people, but forgetting many friends. 
I wanted to do something big with my life, achieve something great, and I thought my carreer is the way to get there.

Today, I've got no girlfriend, but I feel closer to my friends, old and new. I've stopped believing that technical advancement is the meaning
of my life. I feel a great care for the environment now, and I keep asking myself how I can best help protect it. 
I don't want to be independent, but rather be able to rely on the people close to me. I'm trying to open my heart up for this.
