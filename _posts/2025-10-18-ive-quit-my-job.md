Over the last two years I've worked hard to counteract climate change. I started by reducing my own emissions, then I learned to talk to people and try to be a godo influence at work. I have volunteered in various movements and [startups](https://klimatkollen.se/en/), and kept learning so much along the way. Now I have resigned from my job to free up time for full time climate activism - so that I can affect the big decisions in society: laws, investments, policies. That is the place where change is needed.

I believe the largest possibility for change is in social movements practicing peaceful civil resistance and nonviolence. I am no political theorist, but I've seen how [peaceful resistance movements in Sweden get results](https://www.socialchangelab.org/restore-wetlands-campaign), and I think they attack the problem of the climate crisis at its core - not more tech solutions, or more awareness, but the power struggle for political will. I also believe that even if there is a lot that we fail to save, it will have been meaningful and morally just to stand against the atrocious destruction of the planet. What is more, that act itself may prepare us for a harsher world to come, it may practice our resilience and our solidarity. Engagement in civil society strengthens democracy, [which is backsliding in Sweden and other parts of the world](https://v-dem.net/). For all these reasons, <u>I will be helping peaceful and nonviolent civil resistance movements in Sweden</u> with all skills I have at my disposal. But I remain open to revaluate what strategies have the highest chance of success.

How will I sustain myself then? Right now I will have no income. However, I also don't have children, and my savings should last for a years if I've counted correctly - that is is I drastically reduce my spending and move to cheaper housing.

Someone with different circumstances might not have been able to make the same decision. It's not my intention that you, dear reader, should feel pressured to do the exact same thing. But this is my personal answer to the question <u>"What is the most important thing I can do, based on my own circumstances?"</u> - and I do want you to consider that question. I'm here to help, if you would like someone to talk to, about formulating a first step to engaging in a question you care about. It doesn't even have to be climate, just start working for a better society in a way that you care about. I promise - you have more power than you think to influence the future.

Lacking support, there will come a point where I no choice but to go back to work. Could you imagine supporting me financially in any capacity? It's the only way I can keep my focus 100% on the climate crisis. If you somewhat justifiably feel like I've alredy got it good enough, here are [some other people that need it even more](https://www.facebook.com/charlie.andren.56/posts/pfbid0L7TuuYib2oKRwzE1z2iS1W4txgnGTjJ7jMmyG3GVXPJfdxkjsaJSBhctyovddPyDl?rdid=6L1KiWnnoF5x4Auc#). 

I promise to do my best, and to tke care of myself and others. I promise to be honest and transparent about my doubts, about what I don't know. And I promise to stay in touch - this blog will receive regular updates which I hope will be both informative and entertaining ;)

To contact me regarding getting started in your own engagement, questions about financial support, email: <u>ludvig dot janiuk at proton dot me</u>

Thank you to everyone who has helped me so far, in uncountable different ways.
