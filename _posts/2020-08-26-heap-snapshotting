title: Direct Heap Snapshotting in the Java HotSpot VM: a Prototype
---
In 2020, I did my master thesis at Oracle researching a specific way 
to speed up JVM startup time. In a nutshell, can we load an already-initialized
Java Heap image into memory in place of the usual heap initialization process?

My blog post at inside.java has a good description of this work, 
so this page is just a pointer there:
