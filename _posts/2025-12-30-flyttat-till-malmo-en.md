# I've moved to Malmö!

Here I will try my hand at a life. Many people ask me why I am moving - it is so much work to arrange the practicalities, and I already miss my family and friends in Stockholm. It is hard to explain why I need this, even to myself. But when I look out over the starry sky, darker, less polluted by city lights, then I know it feels right. Is my body trying to tell me something about chronic stress?

I hope for meaningful relationships, and I hope to be useful. I also think I need something to mark for myself that a real change has occurred.
