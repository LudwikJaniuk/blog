I just participated in a protest outside the British Embassy in Stockholm.

We were demanding the release of five activists who were
[sentenced to a joint 21-year prison sentence](https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/five-uk-climate-protesters-jailed-conspiracy-block-major-road-2024-07-18/),
for planning a protest. In a democracy, how can peaceful protest carry such a sentence? The answer is it couldn't - the british government
had to [introduce a new law in 2022](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police,_Crime,_Sentencing_and_Courts_Act_2022) making this legal.

The climate crisis is here and now. Every year heat records are broken, meaning that what was a record before becmes the new normal. But this new normal will be unlivable.
[People are dying from overheating](https://www.reuters.com/world/india/unrelenting-heatwave-kills-five-indian-capital-2024-06-19/),
[schools are closing due to heat](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/philippines-dangerous-heat-prompts-shift-online-classes-power-crunch-2024-04-29/).
Extreme weather, floods, fires are becoming more frequent.

Every barrel of oil extracted adds to this. Every new oil field means a worse future for the earth. This is the real crime.

Free Activists! Stop Oil!
