Break a little with me

As temperatures rise, groundwater runs out, and droughts come more often than ever, everyone is affected but not equally.

When you notice your winters getting shorter and shorter, or your coffee getting more expensive, think of a well running out. Think of a failed harvest. You are touching the same thing - will you see it fully, or narrow your view?

What scares me the most is time. Unlike past events we recount with horror, which happened but then were done, now things will be getting worse over my lifetime, no matter what we do. I see wars over water, I see exploitation and greed. I see the few taking everything, and the many silently consenting. This breaks my heart. Please break a little with me.

Oh what a terrible message! It would be understandable, for you to block your ears, close your eyes, and scream "it's not true, it's not true!" like a child told their parent has terminal cancer.

Yet you do me a violence when you whisper "the politicians should deal with it" and fly all inclusive to Tunisia. 
Or when you look down at those trying to stop the death machine with their bodies, and complain, that they're making a fuss.

Break with me and I'll give you of my heart. We'll protect each other when things get worse, as long as we can. When we surrender and give up on the world we were promised but will never have, we can live out of love in the world that is coming.
