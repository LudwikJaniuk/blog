# When does climate messaging become abuse?

Humanity faces many uncomfortable truths, and it makes perfect sense to say "We must change our lifestyles to stay within planetary boundaries." But depending on who is speaking, and at whom this message is addressed, things can go terribly wrong. I'd like to deconstruct this, to get rid of some harmful combinations, and hopefully arrive at the constructive ones.

## Who is the "we" whose lifestyles must change?

Not everyone contributes equally to the deadly emissions of greenhouse gases.
It is the lifestyles and consumption habits of the richest that must change above all. Starting at the other end, i.e. focusing primarily on how the poorest can reduce their emissions without asking the same question about the richest, bears the form of abuse.

## Who is the "we" that is responsible?

There are different views on how social change occurs, but let's remove the obvious. Anyone struggling to survive cannot be held responsible. Anyone who can barely afford healthcare cannot be expected to buy a new electric car.

The "we" who must do something are primarily those of us who have some spare time or money. The more power, the more responsibility. Almost everyone can do something, for example express support. But it is abusive to place the responsibility for change on the most vulnerable. It creates dissonance and distrust.

## Who is the "we" affected by overshooting planetary boundaries?

Again, the poorest are affected first, because they often live in areas that are most exposed to natural disasters, are more severely affected by increased food prices, and lack the opportunity to move, for example.

But in the long run, I claim that everyone is really affected. In the event of a civilization collapse, the bank accounts of the rich will not last forever, inflation can run wild and we all need each other in various social functions. Just because you are doing well right now, don't think that this will protect you. Don't say "how lucky I am that the leak is on the other side of the boat."

## What do we do now?

If you are fighting for your life - keep fighting. Don't let any PR firm make you feel guilty. Ask for help - even though harmful norms might be pushing you to refrain.

If you earn a high income, wield a lot of power, perhaps hold a high office - feel urgently called to reflect on what you are doing with the power you have been given. Lives are at stake. Start by talking to someone else about it. If you want, you can contact me.

If you are somewhere in between - what you can and should do depends on your circumstances. Maybe you can help a friend in need, and that is enough. Maybe you will find a way to help many. Tend to your attention. I emphasize, tend to your attention lest it be hijacked. If you take care of yourself, you may discover much more space than you thought to help others.
