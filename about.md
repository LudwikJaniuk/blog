I live in Stockholm and studied computer science at KTH, master's degree with focus on Theoretical Computer Science. 
Current interests include leadership and change management. I co-run [Stockholm Lean Coffee](https://www.meetup.com/stockholm-lean-coffee/) and participate actively in the climate movement.
