title: About
---
I live in Malmö and engage in full time climate activism. This means many things - from protests to prayer groups. I studied computer science at KTH, master's degree with focus on Theoretical Computer Science. Interests include leadership and change management. I co-ran [Stockholm Lean Coffee](https://www.meetup.com/stockholm-lean-coffee/) and currently run [klimatkalendern](www.klimatkalendern.nu).
